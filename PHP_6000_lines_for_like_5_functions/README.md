# Worst Code Ever
This "controller" "class" has 6800 lines of code, not only was still working on php 5 on 2022, almosto 95% of the functions are copies of the like 5 functions that make selects to DB but with diferent parameters, creator of this, Was proud enoough of this code Even in the frontend added his signature, as if someone should ever ask him to program again.

I have made this code to work with only 1000 lines, but I think I can do better, ENJOY!!!!
